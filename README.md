# Blacktop

A Python3 text-based basketball game.

## Motivation
I made the initial commit for this game while sitting in my US History class. After solely making encryption/decryption software up until this point, I wanted to test my abilities at making a game, with potential expandability. I partially succeeded, but work still needs to be done to make this game fully moddable.

## Dependencies
This game uses my own KermLib, which comes pre-packaged. No external installation necessary.

## How to Play
Simply run main.py, and enjoy!
