# Blacktop

A Python3 text-based basketball game.

## Motivation
I made the initial commit for this game while sitting in my US History class. After solely making encryption/decryption software up until this point, I wanted to test my abilities at making a game, with potential expandability. I partially succeeded, but work still needs to be done to make this game fully moddable.

## Dependencies
This game uses my own KermLib, which comes pre-packaged. No external installation necessary.

## How to Play
Simply run main.py, and enjoy!
There are currently 11 teams in the game: the LA Clippers, the Los Angeles Lakers, the Boston Celtics, the New York Knicks, the Phoenix Suns, the Philadelphia 76ers, the Golden State Warriors, the Orlando Magic, the Dallas Mavericks, the Denver Nuggets, and the New Orleans Pelicans.
<br/> <br/>
Each team runs predominantly their starting lineups, with a few exceptions (Gafford for the Mavericks, Hield for the Warriors, Horford for the Celtics)
